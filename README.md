# My Todo List App
This is a todo list application I built using webpack, vanilla Javascript (using ES6 classes), HTML5, CSS3 and Firebase. 
In addition to being hosted on gh pages at ddevaul.github.io/todo-list, I am hosting this app with Firebase at https://todolist-c8d65.firebaseapp.com/.

## Technologies
### Firebase Authentication
I implemented Firebase as the backend on this app. Now, if a user signs in to their gmail, their todo items and projects will be saved across devices.

### Webpack
I used webpack for bundling modular Javascript.
